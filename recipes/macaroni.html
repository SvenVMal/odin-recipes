    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Macaroni met Ham en Kaas" is a beloved Dutch comfort food dish that combines tender macaroni pasta with diced ham and a creamy, cheesy sauce. The dish is known for its rich and satisfying flavors, making it a favorite among both adults and children. The creamy cheese sauce is made from a roux base, where butter and flour are combined to create a smooth foundation for the milk and cheese. The dish is typically baked to perfection, resulting in a golden-brown, cheesy crust on top. The combination of flavors and textures makes this dish a delightful and hearty option for a cozy family meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g macaroni pasta</li>
        <li>200g cooked ham, diced</li>
        <li>200g grated cheese (typically a mix of Gouda and/or Edam)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>A pinch of nutmeg (optional)</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs (for topping, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Cook the Macaroni:</h4></li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
        Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water.
        Add the macaroni and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
        Drain the macaroni and set aside.</p>
        
        <li><h4>Prepare the Cheese Sauce:</h4></li>
        <p>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
        Add the flour to the melted butter and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for about 2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
        Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
        Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
        Add about 150g of the grated cheese to the sauce and stir until melted and smooth.
        Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg if using.</p>
        
        <li><h4>Combine the Ingredients:</h4></li>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked macaroni, diced ham, and cheese sauce. Mix well to ensure all the macaroni is coated.</p>
        
        <li><h4>Assemble and Bake:</h4></li>
        <p>Transfer the macaroni mixture to a greased baking dish.
        Sprinkle the remaining grated cheese over the top. If desired, you can also sprinkle a thin layer of bread crumbs for added crunch.
        Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the top is golden brown.</p>
        
        <li><h4>Serve:</h4></li>
        <p>Once baked, remove the dish from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
        Serve the macaroni met ham en kaas hot as a comforting and hearty meal.</p>
